# GameJam1123
This project was started as part of a 48 hour Game Jam (8/11/23 4pm - 10/11/23 4pm), in which the theme was "Pressure". 
The concept of the game is a top-down space shooter, where the player must maintain their ships "durability" to prevent pressure loss within the ship.
If the ship loses all of it's pressure, the game ends.
